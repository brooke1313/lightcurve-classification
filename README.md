## Abstract
We present a small study in the classification of (periodic)
stars from the CRTS dataset. Using a Random Forest classifier we achieved a
81.59% classification accuracy on 16 classes of stars.

Raw lightcurve data was analyzed to extract features using the FATS module,
developed by Isadora Nun (github: @isadoranunand) Pavlos Protopapas.

The classes of stars that we considered were:
- ACEP
- Beta-Lyrae
- Blazhko
- Cep II
- EA
- ELL
- EW
- HADS
- Hump
- LADS
- LPV
- PCEB
- RRab
- RRc
- RRd
- RS CVn
